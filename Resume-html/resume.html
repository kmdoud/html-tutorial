            Summary
        </h1>
        <p>
            I am currently enrolled in the . NET bootcamp at MAX technical training, working to become a full stack developer.
            I have decided to take this career change because the movement of business productivity towards IT is something that has always excited me.
            Seeing the opportunity that this bootcamp has given other young people as myself is another huge upside, as I see this being the last major career change
            I will be making.

                Work Experience
            </h1>
            <p>
                Although none of my experience is in the field of IT I can say that the skills I have learned in the workforce up to this point
                are all things that are very transferable to any work culture or enviornment. The biggest being management of employees. My previous position 
                was at a company called SwimSafe Pool Management where I was a Regional Supervisor for the Service Divison. In not so many words I was responsible 
                for customer satisfaction for all of our service clients in the state of Kentucky, which came out to around 40 properties. At any time during the season
                I had about 8-10 technicians reporting to me at once. I was also responsible for speaking directly with the clients who were mostly property managers employed
                by the HOA or COA of the community.
